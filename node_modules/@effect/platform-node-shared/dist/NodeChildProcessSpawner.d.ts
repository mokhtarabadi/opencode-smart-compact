/**
 * Shared Node.js implementation of the child process spawner service.
 *
 * This module adapts `node:child_process.spawn` to the Effect
 * `ChildProcessSpawner` service. Provide {@link layer} to run `ChildProcess`
 * commands in Node-compatible runtimes: commands get scoped process handles
 * with stdin sinks, stdout and stderr streams, exit-code waiting,
 * interruption-time cleanup, process killing, and custom file-descriptor pipes.
 *
 * The implementation sits below the command-building API. It validates and
 * resolves `cwd` through the Effect `FileSystem` and `Path` services,
 * translates Node errno failures to `PlatformError`, and uses scopes to
 * terminate referenced children when the owning effect is interrupted or
 * finalized. Pipelines are flattened by {@link flattenCommand} and spawned one
 * process at a time, wiring the selected source stream (`stdout`, `stderr`,
 * `all`, or `fdN`) to the destination `stdin` or `fdN`.
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
